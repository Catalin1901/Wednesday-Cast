Wednesday series had a huge success with its first season. That s why they decided to film season 2.

This app takes the full cast of the series, generates a number of background actors, and based on the full extended cast calculates the costs of filming the series in a country. It takes into consideration the makeup cost for every type of creature, it generates 3 random menus for vegetarians, flexitarians, and a no-restrictions menu for the cast.
It generates 2 csv, one for the final costs(every cost category such as makeup, transportaion, accomodation, food etc are specified) and one for the menu both in english or romanian as preffered.

The costs are fictive but it can be adapted to work on a real scenario if it is needed and also for other languages.
